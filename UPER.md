The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'
U = "Understand"
P = "Plan"
E = "Execute"
R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

1. Understanding the Problem

---

I need to find out whether the best way to navigate the site would be with toggles that swaps out components or if it would be best to the link the pages

I also don't exactly understand what it means by 'Search Functionality By Product Name'

2. Planning the Solution

---

I have planned out the basic framework in my mind. I will dynamically build a grid system. A flex design that goes 3 across for each row, and if I have time, make it scalable for smaller screens. I will find out how to dynamically input the images of the book covers. I am going to have one main component for the home page with all the products, another page for the product details/option to buy with a quantity option. And finally a shopping cart where the user can "pay" for their books with a form to fill out below a total of all products selected.

Then I am going to edit the main page to make the inventory "dynamic" and, time permitting, will strike through any books that are sold out.

A search component, probably one that reorders the array of files alphabetically by author or genre

A header and possibly a fixed position footer that shows the status of the shopping cart but probably a sidebar where the search function resides

Bonus feature- a display option that sorts the items by author or genre

3. Executing the Plan

---

Search, shopping cart with item#, Display by genre

4. Reflection / Refactor
